There were 25 children in class that day, and we briefly explained what we were testing for and why it might be important.

Two of the children helped to collect the Sulham Brook - Sulham Bridge sample before school that morning. It had rained over night was but dry at the point of sampling.  The Sulham Brook was dry over some of the reach - both upstream and downstream of this location. We chose this site as it was upstream of the Sewerage Treatement Works. 

The rest of the samples were then collected, and taken into school for their Year 4 Science lesson that afternoon. All samples were tested between 1pm to 3pm on 14 September 2015.

The children are studying rivers as their topic this term, so this was a timely experiment - and the reason they helped participate. We tested water from four locations as well as the tap water : 1) Sulham Brook - Sulham Lane Bridge 2) Sulham Brook - downstream of the Sewerage Treatment Works, 3)  River Thames - downstream of the Whitchurch Bridge 4) River Pang - upstream of Reading Road Bridge and 5) tap water in school. 

We did the experiments in the classroom. We tried our best not to get the samples muddled and to remember to wash out the see through testing box twice before each test - but it is possible that we forgot to do so for one or two of the tests! We did some of the samples more than once as we had extra testing kits.

We gave each child a copy of the 'FreshWaterWatch' form and talked them through filling in the form - including going onto the website http://www.gridreferencefinder.com/ to find the longitude and the latitude.

All in all it was a very busy and happy afternoon, filled with excited children doing 'real science' and contributing to the
Water Blitz results. We look forward to seeing how the results fit into the larger picture.

There were 25 children in class that day, and we briefly explained what we were testing for and why it might be important.

The water from this location was collected without the children's help. 

After all the samples were collected, these were taken into school for their Year 4 Science lesson that afternoon. All samples were tested between 1pm to 3pm on 14 September 2015.

The children are studying rivers as their topic this term, so this was a timely experiment - and the reason they helped participate. We tested water from four locations as well as the tap water : 1) Sulham Brook - Sulham Lane Bridge 2) Sulham Brook - downstream of the Sewerage Treatment Works, 3)  River Thames - downstream of the Whitchurch Bridge 4) River Pang - upstream of Reading Road Bridge and 5) tap water in school. 

We did the experiments in the classroom. We tried our best not to get the samples muddled and to remember to wash out the see through testing box twice before each test - but it is possible that we forgot to do so for one or two of the tests! We did some of the samples more than once as we had extra testing kits.

We gave each child a copy of the 'FreshWaterWatch' form and talked them through filling in the form - including going onto the website http://www.gridreferencefinder.com/ to find the longitude and the latitude.

All in all it was a very busy and happy afternoon, filled with excited children doing 'real science' and contributing to the
Water Blitz results. We look forward to seeing how the results fit into the larger picture.

I received the sample kit in my office and we followed the instructions collecting a sample of fresh water from the river. The Phosphate concentration appeared to be 0.1, while the Nitrate is between 5 and 10 (closer to ten judging by the colour).
The place where we took the sample is close to some local wildlife sites but also several farms with livestock surround the river.
